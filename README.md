# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model

**A machine learning-based predictive model to identify customers likely to leave a bank — enabling data-driven customer retention strategies.**

---

## 📑 Description

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning algorithms trained on a real-world bank customer dataset. By analyzing patterns in customer behavior, transactions, and demographics, the model aims to forecast which customers are at risk of leaving the bank.

Ideal for financial institutions looking to minimize customer attrition and optimize retention strategies, this solution demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and classification techniques in a real business context.
